                <h3>SQL</h3>
                1.RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)
                2.These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema
                3.These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.
                4.These databases are best suited for complex queries
                <h3>No SQL</h3>
                1.Non-relational or distributed database system.
                2.They have dynamic schema
                3.These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage
                4.These databases are not so good for complex queries

                <h2>(3)What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h2>
                <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.

                    It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.

                    The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.

                    JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesnâ€™t have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.</p>
